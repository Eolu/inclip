# inclip

This is a simple terminal utility for interacting with the system clipboard that should work on most platforms. Running it with no arguments will echo the system clipboard. Running the `inclip diff [FILE]` subcommand will allow you to compare clipboard content to a file. Running `inclip diff` without a file arg will cause the program to pause and wait for input, allowing you to change the clipboard contents and compare the previous contents to the new contents. `inclip copy` can be used to echo into the clipboard (rather than from the clipboard).

```
USAGE:
    inclip
        Echo clipboard content
    inclip diff [file] [args...]
        Perform a comparison of clipboard content
        against a file or other clipboard
        content. On Mac and Linux, accepts all
        args that the `diff` command accepts. On
        Windows, accepts all args that the 
        `fc.exe` command accepts. If a file is
        included, it must come before all other
        arguments that would usually be passed to
        diff or fc.exe. 
    inclip copy [file]
        Echos either standard input OR a file into
        the clipboard.
